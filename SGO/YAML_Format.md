# Formal Representation of the Ontology

We use a YAML format to describe the [type system](../SGO_NTO_and_all_that.md) of both SGO and NTO enabling/mapping. 

Instead of presenting some grammer definition we present an example [here](example_extension_request.yaml). 

## used naming conventions:

* upper camel case for node type identifiers
* lower camel case for property names (edge type identifiers and attribute name)
  * _ (underscore) followed by lower camel case for internally managed properties (those that can be read but not written)
