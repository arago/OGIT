	dcterms:description """To express how statements in a model can be reifiable, this property is used to explicitly associate a property with a user-defined sub-class of \"rdf:Statement\". A recommended way of using this is to declare the properties that share the same reification constructs as sub-properties of a parent property that carries the \"vaem:reifiableBy\" property. The parent property should be of type \"rdf:Property\" so that it can have both datatype and object properties as sub-properties. By this means use and transformations of a model can be understood through a fully specified metamodel. \"vaem:reifiableBy\" is rangeless in order to comply with OWL DL semantics. Its range would have been rdfs:Class in order to refer to \"rdf:Statement\" sub-classes""";
