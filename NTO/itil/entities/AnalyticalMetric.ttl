	dcterms:description "An itil:AnalyticalMetric is a used to separate out certain metrics that are really more helpful for supporting research into an issue, incident or service problem. The itil:AnalyticalMetric(s) are metrics that IT service providers may report on only on a one-time basis or as part of a drill-down (such as for an itil:Dashboard). IT frequently makes the mistake of including these in regular reporting to senior management ‘just in case’. This results in a lot of wasted labor in building reports and clouds real management issues that need to be addressed.";
