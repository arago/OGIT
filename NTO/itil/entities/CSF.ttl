	dcterms:description "An itil:CSF is something that must happen if a process, project, plan, or IT service is to succeed. An itil:CSF is an itil:Metric that represents key operational performance requirements which indicate whether a process, IT service or activity is performing successfully from a customer or business perspective. One way to define itil:CSF(s) is by customer assets and the service archetypes. For example, in healthcare, IT service providers have extensive knowledge of hospital procedures, medical equipment, interactions between physicians, clinicians and pharmacists, insurance policies and privacy regulations. IT service providers present in market spaces related to the quality of outcomes in healthcare typically have physicians and clinicians on their payroll. Service strategies for the healthcare market spaces take into account the need to deal with users with highly specialized skills, special-purpose equipment, low tolerance for error, and the need to balance security with usability of services. These are itil:CSF(s) for a cluster of market spaces related to healthcare. A subset of these itil:CSF(s) is shared by other market spaces such as military applications. The itil:CSF(s) can therefore span more than one market space. They represent opportunities for leveraging economies of scale and scope. The itil:KPI(s) are used to measure the achievement of each itil:CSF. A recommended approach for deriving an itil:CSF is to first identify which itil:KPI(s) relate to it and then rate the itil:CSF based on the lowest valued observed in any one of those itil:KPI(s).";
