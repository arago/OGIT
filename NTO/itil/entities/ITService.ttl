	dcterms:description "An itil:ITService is a service provided to one or more itil:Customer(s) by an itil:ITServiceProvider. That is, an itil:ITService represents the means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes, and it should be defined in an itil:SLA. An itil:ITService is based on the use of information technology and supports the customer’s business processes (in fact, many business processes rely on IT services). As customers and suppliers become the direct users of IT services, the expectations and service level requirements (SLRs) have become more demanding, requiring a value net approach. An outcome-based definition of service moves IT service providers beyond business-IT alignment towards business-IT integration. An outcome is the result of carrying out an activity; following a process; delivering an IT service etc. The term outcome is used to refer to intended results, as well as to actual results. Each itil:ITService defines a set of itil:Metric(s) whose purpose is to measure the quality and effectiviness of that service in order to take timely actions that make sure service are delivered in line with business needs. These are the metrics that really matter in order to demonstrate the value of the service and for the operation in a cycle of continuous improvement. Also, itil:ITService(s) are managed according to an itil:ServiceLifecycle and they are composed of itil:Application(s) and other itil:CI(s) necessary to support the provision of the itil:ITService to the business.";
