	dcterms:description "The itil:ServiceCatalogManagement is the process that provides a single source of consistent information on all of the agreed services, and ensures that it is widely available to those who are approved to access it. The objective of the itil:ServiceCatalogManagement process is to manage the information contained within the service catalog, and to ensure that it is accurate and reflects the current details, status, interfaces and dependencies of all services that are being run, or being prepared to run, in the live environment. The service catalog has two aspects: * The Business Service Catalog: containing details of all the IT services delivered to the customer, together with relationships to the business units and the business process that rely on the IT services. This is the customer view of the service catalog. * The Technical Service Catalog: containing details of all the IT services delivered to the customer, together with relationships to the supporting services, shared services, components and CIs necessary to support the provision of the service to the business. This should underpin the Business Service Catalog and not form part of the customer view. Some organizations only maintain either a Business Service Catalog or a Technical Service Catalog. The preferred situation adopted by the more mature organizations maintains both aspects within a single service catalog, which is part of a totally integrated ITSM activity and service portfolio. The Business Service Catalog facilitates the development of a much more proactive or even pre-emptive itil:ServiceLevelManagement process, allowing it to develop more into the field of Business Service Management (BSM). The Technical Service Catalog is extremely beneficial when constructing the relationship between services, SLAs, OLAs and other underpinning agreements and components, as it will identify the technology required to support a service and the support group(s) that support the components. The combination of a Business Service Catalog and a Technical Service Catalog is invaluable for quickly assessing the impact of incidents and changes on the business.
