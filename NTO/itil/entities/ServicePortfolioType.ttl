ogit.ITIL:ServicePortfolioType
	a rdfs:Class;
	rdfs:subClassOf ogit:Entity;
	rdfs:label "Service Portfolio Type";
	ogit:original <http://wwwvs.cs.hs-rm.de/itil#ServicePortfolioType>;
	dcterms:description "The specific value that represents the type of a specific itil:ServicePortfolio. The itil:ServicePortfolio is used to manage the entire lifecycle of all itil:ITService(s), and it includes three categories: Service pipeline (proposed or in development), service catalog (live or available for deployment) and retired services. * Service Pipeline: The Service Pipeline is a database or structured document listing all itil:ITService(s) that are under consideration or development, but are not yet available to customers. The Service Pipeline provides a business view of possible future itil:ITService(s) and is part of the itil:ServicePortfolio which is not normally published to itil:Customer(s). These services are to be phased into operation by itil:ServiceTransition after completion of design, development, and testing. The pipeline represents the IT service provider’s growth and strategic outlook for the future. The general health of the itil:ITServiceProvider is reflected in the pipeline. It also reflects the extent to which new service concepts and ideas for improvement are being fed by itil:ServiceStrategy, itil:ServiceDesign and itil:CSI. Good itil:FinancialManagement is necessary to ensure adequate funding for the pipeline. * Service Catalog: The Service Catalog is a database or structured document with information about all live itil:ITService(s), including those available for deployment. The Service Catalog is basic aspect of all itil:ITServiceProvider, and it is the only part of the itil:ServicePortfolio published to customers, and is used to support the sale and delivery of itil:ITService(s). As mentioned earlier, the itil:ServicePortfolio is the complete set of itil:ITService(s) that are managed by an itil:ITServiceProvider. The Service Catalog includes information about deliverables, prices, contact points, ordering and request processes.  The Service Catalog is a key element containing valuable information on the complete set of services offered. It should preferably be stored as a set of ‘service’ CIs within a Configuration Management System (CMS), maintained under the itil:ChangeManagement process. As it is such a valuable set of information it should be available to anyone within the itil:Organization. Every new itil:ITService should immediately be entered into the Service Catalog once its initial definition of requirements has been documented and agreed. The Service Catalog should record the status of every itil:ITService, through the itil:ServiceStage(s) of its defined itil:ServiceLifecycle. The Service Catalog will also show the relationship between itil:ITService(s) and itil:Application(s). A single itil:Application could be part of more than one itil:ITService, and a single itil:ITService could use more than one itil:Application. A Service Catalog is also a collection of LOS, each under the control of a product manager.  * Retired Services: Some services in the itil:ServicePortfolio are phased out or retired. Phasing out of services is part of itil:ServiceTransition. This is to ensure that all commitments made to customers are duly fulfilled and service assets are released from contracts. When services are retired, the related knowledge and information are stored in a knowledge base for future use: Retired Services. Retired Services are not available to new customers or contracts unless a special business case is made. Such services may be reactivated into operations under special conditions and SLAs that are to be approved by senior management. This is necessary because such services may cost a lot more to support and may disrupt economies of scale and scope.";
