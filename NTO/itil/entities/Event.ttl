	dcterms:description "An itil:Event is any detectable or discernible occurrence that has significance for the management of the IT infrastructure or the delivery of an IT service and evaluation of the impact a deviation might cause to the services. The itil:Event(s) are typically notifications created by an itil:ITService, itil:CI or monitoring tool and they have an itil:Lifecycle. An itil:Event typically requires IT Operations personnel to take actions, and often lead to incidents being logged. Events occur continuously, but not all of them are detected or registered. It is therefore important that everybody involved in designing, developing, managing and supporting IT services and the IT infrastructure that they run on understands what types of events need to be detected and considered itil:Events. Also, activities undertaken to manage a specific itil:Event should  be documented. There are many different types of itil:Events, for example: * Events that signify regular operation: ‐ Notification that a scheduled workload has completed. ‐ A user has logged in to use an application. ‐ An e-mail has reached its intended recipient. * Events that signify an exception: ‐ A user attempts to log on to an application with the incorrect password. ‐ An unusual situation has occurred in a business process that may indicate an exception requiring further business investigation (for example, a Web page alert indicates that a payment authorization site is unavailable – impacting financial approval of business transactions). ‐ A device’s CPU is above the acceptable utilization rate. ‐ A PC scan reveals the installation of unauthorized software. * Events that signify unusual, but not exceptional, operation. These are an indication that the situation may require closer monitoring. In some cases the condition will resolve itself, for example in the case of an unusual combination of workloads – as they are completed, normal operation is restored. In other cases, operator intervention may be required if the situation is repeated or if it continues for too long. These rules or policies are defined in the Monitoring and Control Objectives for that device or service. Examples of this type of event are: ‐ A server’s memory utilization reaches within 5% of its highest acceptable performance level. ‐ The completion time of a transaction is 10% longer than normal.";
