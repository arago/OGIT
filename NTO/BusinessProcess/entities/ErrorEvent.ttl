	dcterms:description """Entitiy to store potential process errors as a step toward 
eliminating them, or as part of modeling escalation processes. In BPMN, error events are represented by a flash symbol.
The BPMN specification does not specify what an error may be, the modeler has to decide that.
An error is a serious event in BPMN, so if catching, it can be modeled only as an attached intermediate event. 
This means that an error during task execution must be handled in a specific way: As a throwing event, it can be modeled 
only at the end of a process path so that the participant knows the process has failed. The parent process should likewise 
recognize the failure.""";
