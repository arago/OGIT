	dcterms:description """
<p>Fact tables contain actual measurements for projects, systems, or things.
In practice, there may be many measurements and they may be updated frequently.
The measurements may be at a finer level of granularity than the estimates,
e.g. a project may estimate total defects found per month,
whereas the actual number found may be collected daily.
Furthermore, these measurements are often collected automatically by software development tools
such as bug tracking systems or source code control systems.
It may therefore be useful to simply refer to the source of the measurements rather than copy
the actual measurements into the EMS service provider,
e.g. a dynamic query on a software tool may generate the fact table on demand.</p>

<p>This property lets you refer to the remote source of the fact table data via a URL.
An HTTP GET request on this URL MUST return an
<a href=\"#FactTable\"><code>ems:FactTable</code></a> resource whose
<code>dcterms:title</code> and
<a href=\"#head\"><code>ems:head</code></a> properties match this resource.</p>""";
