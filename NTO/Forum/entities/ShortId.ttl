	dcterms:description """A Reference to another Entity, used to track access via a specific channel/referrer.
For example in TabTab, a Post has many shortIds which relate to different sharing
methods, e.g. one for Twitter, one for Yammer, one for Email, etc... TabTab uses them
as 'short urls' in the App and redirect the user to the correct content after tracking
the access by the channel (`ogit/function`) attribute. The `ogit/function` attribute
is used for this as the function of this shortId is to track a specific channel of
inbound traffic. The ShortId can be used without this channel/referrer data, albeit
to more limited use.
The `ogit/id` attribute in this instance would be a short URL safe string.""";
